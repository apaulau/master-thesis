### What to do next? Enjoy:

* Find out how to use shiny. I think it will be useful and with it's help I can show a great product.

* Use a code style (e.g. [google-styleguide](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Rguide.xml))

* Aim is to achieve modularity: special module for descriptive statistics, special for variogram and so on. (__Main goal for the first time__)

* ~~Find out more about [packrat](http://rstudio.github.io/packrat): dependency manager.~~

* Reformat and refactor code. Clean up useless files.

* Add computation block (for some non-visual analysis)

* Add descriptive statistics to computation block. Or somewhere else.

* Add normality tests to computation block.
