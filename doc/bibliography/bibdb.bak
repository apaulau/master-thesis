  title = {Influence of Long-Distance Climate Teleconnection on Seasonality
	of Water Temperature in the World's Largest Lake - Lake Baikal, Siberia},

  abstract = {<p>Large-scale climate change is superimposed on interacting patterns
	of climate variability that fluctuate on numerous temporal and spatial
	scales—elements of which, such as seasonal timing, may have important
	impacts on local and regional ecosystem forcing. Lake Baikal in Siberia
	is not only the world's largest and most biologically diverse lake,
	but it has exceptionally strong seasonal structure in ecosystem dynamics
	that may be dramatically affected by fluctuations in seasonal timing.
	We applied time-frequency analysis to a near-continuous, 58-year
	record of water temperature from Lake Baikal to examine how seasonality
	in the lake has fluctuated over the past half century and to infer
	underlying mechanisms. On decadal scales, the timing of seasonal
	onset strongly corresponds with deviation in the zonal wind intensity
	as described by length of day (LOD); on shorter scales, these temperature
	patterns shift in concert with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO).
	Importantly, the connection between ENSO and Lake Baikal is gated
	by the cool and warm periods of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO).
	Large-scale climatic phenomena affecting Siberia are apparent in
	Lake Baikal surface water temperature data, dynamics resulting from
	jet stream and storm track variability in central Asia and across
	the Northern Hemisphere.</p>},
