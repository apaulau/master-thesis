  abstract = {<p>Large-scale climate change is superimposed on interacting patternsof
	climate variability that fluctuate on numerous temporal and spatialscales—elements
	of which, such as seasonal timing, may have importantimpacts on local
	and regional ecosystem forcing. Lake Baikal in Siberiais not only
	the world's largest and most biologically diverse lake,but it has
	exceptionally strong seasonal structure in ecosystem dynamicsthat
	may be dramatically affected by fluctuations in seasonal timing.We
	applied time-frequency analysis to a near-continuous, 58-yearrecord
	of water temperature from Lake Baikal to examine how seasonalityin
	the lake has fluctuated over the past half century and to inferunderlying
	mechanisms. On decadal scales, the timing of seasonalonset strongly
	corresponds with deviation in the zonal wind intensityas described
	by length of day (LOD); on shorter scales, these temperaturepatterns
	shift in concert with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO).Importantly,
	the connection between ENSO and Lake Baikal is gatedby the cool and
	warm periods of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO).Large-scale
	climatic phenomena affecting Siberia are apparent inLake Baikal surface
	water temperature data, dynamics resulting fromjet stream and storm
	track variability in central Asia and acrossthe Northern Hemisphere.</p>},
