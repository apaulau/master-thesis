### What to do next? Enjoy:

* Find out how to use shiny. I think it will be useful and with it's help I can show this as great product.

* ~~Use a code style (e.g. [google-styleguide](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Rguide.xml))~~

* Aim is to achieve modularity: special module for descriptive statistics, special for variogram and so on.

* ~~Find out more about [packrat](http://rstudio.github.io/packrat): dependency manager.~~

* Reformat and refactor code. Clean up useless files. _Almost done_

* ~~Add computation block (for some non-visual analysis)~~

* ~~Add descriptive statistics to computation block. Or somewhere else.~~

* ~~Add normality tests to computation block.~~

* Reimplement (cmd-c+cmd-v+reformat) tests for normality in separate module (?)

* Fix references in TeX

* Check new versions of automap.

* Variogram analysis must be converted to eye-candy view.
