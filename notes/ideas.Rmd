### Some ideas for you:

* It will be fabuluos if within _Shiny_ will be possible to implement multiple tab application: each tab will be responsible
  for different functionality (e.g. different graphs or tables). It will be nice feature for presentatation.
 
* Structure of the project in my mind: first of all computation, and after all printing
    + But. In this way if you need to recompute some part of all work then you should seek at least two places in code and execute each.
    + So this point is for deep thinking.

* Use monochormatic theme for graphs. So with this trick you will see the result like as for printing.

* Implement i18n: basic dictionary based on `data.frame`. At the beginning we choose language (russian/english), and based on it
  use one column with keycodes or another.
  
* Implement plots through closures: save useful variable, aka constants, in wider scope, but private.

* Combine save with computing plots: also mb as show an save.

* __Instead of output all testing (e.g. normality) information, output only useful values. And then use it to paste into tex document inline.__
